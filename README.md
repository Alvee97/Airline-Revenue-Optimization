# Airline Revenue Optimization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing airline revenue through data analysis of customer booking patterns, pricing strategies, and operational costs. By using Python and SQL, key revenue drivers were identified to optimise seat occupancy and profitability, helping airlines make smarter decisions with their pricing and operations.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to provide insights that improve airline profitability through data-driven strategies for pricing and bookings. By analyzing patterns in seat occupancy and demand, the project aims to help airlines optimise pricing and maximize revenue per flight.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and building data models.
- **SQL**: To query and manipulate data for better insights.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and calculations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualisation and exploring trends.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing airline booking information, such as flight details, pricing, customer demographics, and booking behaviour. It covers key factors that impact booking patterns and revenue generation.

## Project Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the data by addressing missing values and inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed booking behaviours, seasonal demand, and pricing trends.
3. **Revenue Optimization**: Built models to understand how pricing and seat occupancy relate, helping identify ways to optimise revenue.
4. **Insights**: Provided strategic recommendations on pricing and seat allocation to help maximise airline revenue.

## Key Insights:
- Found important patterns between customer booking habits and seat occupancy.
- Developed pricing strategies based on demand forecasting to increase profitability during peak seasons.
- Suggested discount strategies to boost occupancy during off-peak times.

## Conclusion
This project shows how airlines can optimize their revenue using data analysis. By understanding customer booking behaviours and optimising pricing strategies, airlines can improve profitability and operational efficiency.
